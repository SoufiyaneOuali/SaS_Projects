# SaS_Projects
This is the collection of my own SAS utility macros/ sample code over my past 2 years of SAS programming and analysis experience from 2019 to 2021

Please note that all code is provided as it is. I don't have access to SAS now and I can't test any changes or provide support to make the code workable to SAS new versions.
